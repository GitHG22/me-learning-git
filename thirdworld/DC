Limits
------
LHL=RHL. limit exists.
f(a-h)=f(a+h)
The limits must be finite. not infinity or oscillating.

Continuity 
---------- 
LHL=RHL=f(a) 
must exit in domain. 
if checking in interval (a,b), see LHL of b and RHL of a.
to check continuity
see if there is break in graph.
to find limit:-
1. formula method
sinx/x x0 1 tanx/x x0 1 1-cosx/x x0 0 sin-1x/x xx0 1 tan-1x/x x0 1 (f(x))^gx fx 1 gx infinity egx*fx-1 ln1+x/x 1 a^x-1/x lna
2. LH Rule
3. expansion
e^x = 1+x+x^2/2+x^3/3!
sinx=x-x^3/3!+x5/5!
cos=1-x2/2!+x4/4!
ln1+x=x-x2/2+x3/3-x4/4
tanx=x+x2/3+2/15x3
xn-an/x-a=nan-1
If gif is present in denominator, domain problem might exist. 
xn-1/xn+1xinfinity
check lhl rhl separately if :-
break in any point in graph
compound fnfunction
play safe
sandwich theorem
if hx lies between fx and gx for an interval, and limit fx =limit gx, lim hx equals limit fx
used in gifs. 

Differentiability
-----------------
if lhd-rhd, fnfunction is differentiable. fnfunction is diff only if it is smooth. at pointed edges, sharp turns, it is not differentiable.
if a fn is continous, it may/may not be diff
if fn is dis cont, it is not diff
if fn is not diff, it not or be cont
if fn is diff, it is cont
to checkk diff, firsst check continuity
METHODS TO CHECK DIFF
1. direct diff
2. lhd rhd
3. graph

direct diff
see if contn or nnot. if di, no cont see lhs and rhs defn and lhd rhd
simple fn are contnous in their domain

limis and derivatives
lHL=RHD*-->0+fx

if rhd oscillating, rhl=fx
if rhd infinity, rhl=/=fx
if rhd 0, rhl = fx
ie to say, if rhl = fx, rhd might exist
if rhd exists, rhl=fx
